	<h1>Predicate!</h1>
	<p>The searchbar splits the string 
	at each space character and checks 
	each substring with the following 
	query:
	
(title LIKE \'%" + splitsearch[i] + "%\' "
 + "or year = \'" + splitsearch[i] + "\' "
 + "or director LIKE \'" + splitsearch[i] + "%\' "
 + "or director LIKE \'%" + splitsearch[i] + "\' "
 + "or first_name LIKE \'" + splitsearch[i] + "%\' "
 + "or last_name LIKE \'" + splitsearch[i] + "%\' ) ";
        
Each query is separated with an "AND"
        
        
         
        	      	  query += " and 
        System.out.println("query :  " + query);
      	  
       query += " GROUP BY movies.id "; 
	()</p>
