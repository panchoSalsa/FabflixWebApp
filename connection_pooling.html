<h1>Connection Pooling</h1>
<p>We use two types of resources in connection pooling.<br>
One resource is for writing and the other is for reading.<br>
All the writes are supposed to go to the master slave instance.<br>
We had to modify the write resource with the ip of the master instance.<br>
A connection from this pool is granted everytime we do writes to our databases<br>
from our servlets.</p>
